# uxma-student-status

My plan:

1. First, create a way to add a bunch of students as "profiles"
2. Next, allow the user to select students for each day. The user can submit and add a student to each day, thus adding that day to the "attendance" array.
3. Finally, have ONLY the data of students in attendance in rows below, which allow the user to edit their report. **MUST BE IN A TABLE**

Extra:
* Add the ability to delete students entirely
* Add the ability to remove a student from the created list

I used this as a basis for creating a table: https://jsbin.com/qikaguquxo/edit?html,css,js,console,output
And used this as a basis for creating the ability to add certain days for certain students: https://jsbin.com/coxobadiku/edit?html,js,console,output
